# BuildInfo - ASP.NET Core - Azure Devops

This repo contains a support package to be used in ASP.NET Core applications that want to include a BuildInfo endpoint.
The actual build info is fetched during the build on an Azure Devops agent.

It can also be used to get hold of build info to add to swagger.
